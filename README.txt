When the program is launched one of the users pushes the workout button to request a workout.
Whoever pushes the workout button becomes player1.
The other player is, surprisingly, player2.

Pushing the workout button displays a workout request on the oled screen.
Pushing the no button will, at this point, terminate the program.
Pushing the yes button will make the LED/KEY display turn on.

Now you can choose which workout you would like to do by pushing the buttons on the LED/KEY display.
Pushing a button on the LED/KEY display will show the workout on the oled display.
By pushing the no button you refuse the workout and will be able to choose another one.
Pushing the yes button once will display yes on the oled display to show the workout has been accepted.
Pushing the yes button once more will make the oled display the specifics of the workout.

The LED/KEY display will now show 8 zeros.
Here you are supposed to do the workout.
You can push button 8 for each set you do and the number will be shown on the diplay.
When you are done working out you press button 1 to exit.

When both players are done working out their results will be displayed on the oled.
Finally the winner and loser will be determined.
If you lost the oled will display "YOU LOSE :(".
If you won the oled will display "YOU WIN".


If you feel up for it you can now request another workout and do it all again.
