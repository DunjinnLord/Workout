INSTRUCTIONS:

When the program is launched one of the users pushes the workout button to request a workout.
Whoever pushes the workout button becomes player1.
The other player is, surprisingly, player2.

Pushing the workout button displays a workout request on the oled screen.
Pushing the no button will, at this point, reset player1 to player2.
Pushing the yes button will make the LED/KEY display turn on.

Now player1 can suggest which workout to do by pushing the buttons on the LED/KEY display.
Pushing a button on the LED/KEY display will show the workout on the oled display.

Player2 can now either accept or decline the suggested workout by player1.
By pushing the no button player2 declines the suggested workout and player1 will have to suggest another one.
Pushing the yes button will show the specifics of the workout ie. how many seconds or reps a set consists of.

The LED/KEY display will now show 8 zeros.
Here you are supposed to do the workout.
Both players can  push button 8 for each set they do and the number will be shown on the diplay.
When you are done working out you press button 1 to exit.

When both players are done working out their results will be displayed on the oled.
Finally the winner and loser will be determined.
If you lost the oled will display "YOU LOSE".
If you won the oled will display "YOU WIN".
If it is a draw the oled will display "DRAW"


If you feel up for it you can now request another workout and do it all again.
